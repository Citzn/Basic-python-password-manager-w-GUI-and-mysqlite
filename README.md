# Basic-python-password-manager-w-GUI-and-mysqlite

I'm actually pretty proud of this project, learned a whole lot from this like: Some better grasp on OOP because I figured out how to write programs with GUIs in mind which is a complete improvement from last time (2021's GUI project), overwriting classes written in libraries as well as a small bit SQL with how you store and retrieve data.

Tldr;

Learned:
- General idea behind SQL databases through mysqlite,
- Better grasp on OOP - Knowing how to with GUIs in mind I spent less time wrangling this GUI library than tkinter,
- Overwriting imported library classes for custom jobs that I needed.
